lbBased:        Based on original science of:
projectile1:    The projectile lands intact, with a velocity
projectile2:    The energy lost in the atmosphere is 
projectile3:    The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of 
projectile4:    The velocity of the projectile fragments after the burst is 
projectile5:    The energy of the airburst is 
projectile6:    Large fragments strike the surface and may create a crater strewn field.  A more careful treatment of atmospheric entry is required to accurately estimate the size-frequency distribution of meteoroid fragments and predict the number and size of craters formed.
projectile7:    The projectile reaches the ground in a broken condition.  The mass of the projectile strikes the surface at  a velocity of
